# Component Testing
In this Repo there are three Services (Address service),(TechStack service) and (Employee service) .
Employee Service is calling TechStack and Address using webclient and wrap their response in employee object.
Soo i had written unit test cases in Address Service and TechStack Service and Component TestCase in EmployeeService by mocking behavior of other service and give a mockresponse and test employee Controller
